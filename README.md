Why This Project?
As of 2024, New York City led the world in urban automobile traffic congestion, despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system.
Together, the iconic Yellow Taxi and other app-based for-hire vehicles(FHV) such as Uber and Lyft, make up 53% of traffic in high-density areas within Manhattan.
In recent years, New York City introduced congestion surcharges and tolls to tackle traffic.
At the same time, weather remains a constant challenge for both drivers and passengers â€” slippery roads, reduced visibility, and fluctuating demand.

Project Overview
The project is about analysing the NYC taxi data and evaluating the 2 main congestion pricing programs implemented and aims to identify any patterns or trends that can be used to improve taxi services and traffic in NYC.
Moreover, we wanted to assess its correlation with weather conditions to understand how weather conditions affect taxi demand and supply in NYC.


What are our Hypothesis?
Have the congestion fees impacted the volume of rides?
Can the optimization of patterns in cruising time and utilization rate be used to improve taxi services and traffic in NYC?
Are tips and weather determining factors for high demand in congestion zones?
