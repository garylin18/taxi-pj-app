    ### Project Overview
    - The project is about analysing the NYC taxi data and evaluating the 2 main congestion pricing programs implemented and aims to identify any patterns or trends that can be used to improve taxi services and traffic in NYC.
    - Moreover, we wanted to assess its correlation with weather conditions to understand how weather conditions affect taxi demand and supply in NYC.
    
    ### What are our Hypothesis?
    - Have the congestion fees impacted the volume of rides?
    - Can the optimization of patterns in cruising time and utilization rate be used to improve taxi services and traffic in NYC?
    - Are tips and weather determining factors for high demand in congestion zones?
    
    ### Data source
    - Data source: Meteostat, New York City TLC (https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/your-ride.page)
    - Period of data: 
      - Impact of congestion pricing: 01.01.2019- 31.01.2025
      - Assessment of cruising rate, tips and weather: 01.01.2024 - 31-12-2024
    - Sampling rate: 5%
