    ## Why This Project?

### As of 2024, New York City led the world in urban automobile traffic congestion, despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system.
### Together, the iconic Yellow Taxi and other app-based for-hire vehicles(FHV) such as Uber and Lyft, make up 53% of traffic in high-density areas within Manhattan.
### In recent years, New York City introduced congestion surcharges and tolls to tackle traffic.
### At the same time, weather remains a constant challenge for both drivers and passengers â€” slippery roads, reduced visibility, and fluctuating demand.

#We wanted to find out.

#But the big question is:
#Are these policies and natural conditions really influencing taxi operations and commuter behaviour?

#Are congestion fees actually reducing traffic or just shifting the cost to riders?
#Are these extra charges affecting ride numbers equally to both traditional yellow taxis and other app-based for-hire vehicles?
#Do factors such as tips influence the demand of rides within congestion zones despite the extra costs?
#And does bad weather genuinely impact how many people take taxis despite increased costs?
#This project dives into the data to answer those questions â€” helping city planners, taxi operators, and the public make smarter, data-driven decisions.
